idk if the links to arachne work, but they’re here:

Using Arachne Simple
Return to: MINERvA masterclass Neutrino Masterclass Project Map   To use Arachne Simple, go to Arachne based on the dataset you will analyze. Arachne Datasets:

also an arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5315

Arachne - A web-based event viewer for MINERvA
Neutrino interaction events in the MINERvA detector are visually represented with a web-based tool called Arachne. Data are retrieved from a central server via AJAX, and client-side JavaScript draws images into the user's browser window using the draft HTML 5 standard. These technologies allow neutrino interactions to be viewed by anyone with a web browser, allowing for easy hand-scanning of particle interactions. Arachne has been used in MINERvA to evaluate neutrino data in a prototype detector, to tune reconstruction algorithms, and for public outreach and education.

also they took down the fermilab frog site, but it’s archived here https://web.archive.org/web/20240612221454/https://ed.fnal.gov/projects/frogs/index.html
