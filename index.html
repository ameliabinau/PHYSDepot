        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p><strong>PHYSDepot</strong> is a repository of physics resources helpful to physicists at all stages — from
            beginners to professional researchers. Our goal is to curate tools, packages, simulations, and educational
            materials that lower the barrier to entry and empower both students and scientists alike.</p>

        <p>Whether you are just beginning your journey or working on advanced research, PHYSDepot is built to support
            your
            work. This platform was inspired by the struggle many scientists face when access to mentorship and
            educational
            opportunities is limited. We aim to connect, unify, and enable exploration through science and learning.</p>
