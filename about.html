        <p><strong>About the Creators & Our Mission</strong></p>
        <p>Despite coming from different educational backgrounds, the creators of PHYSDepot have shared a similar experience: a life-long struggle discovering and accessing quality resources in the field of physics. As children, we (Amelia & Ricky) both shared a curiosity to explore what physics research looked like for both students and professionals. How do the showy results that appear in the headlines actually come to fruition? Excited to pursue physics as a career and desperate to begin building skills, we both did the best we could to provide for ourselves the mentorship with which we had little financial or logistical access. We began to realize how high the barrier to entry is on simply exploring and reading about the open-source tools scientists across the world use to derive their results. Even locating resources designed to lower this barrier proved challenging if we found ourselves alone in our interests.</p>

        <p>Moving on to pursue bachelors degrees in physics, Amelia and Ricky surprisingly saw this chasm only grow. Despite managing to cross the hurdle that is pursuing and financing a degree in physics, they found many of their peers were struggling to secure research experiences, mentorship, or any other form of direction required to pursue their dreams. Regardless of how successful they were in their coursework or other academic endeavors, many students were left in the dust for semesters at a time as resources on the colligate level were still found scarce. Even graduate students and other professional peers found it difficult to access knowledge in fields tangential to their own.</p>
        <p><strong>It became strikingly clear: one of the biggest hurdles to pursuing physics research is learning where to look.</strong></p>
        <p>After securing semesters of guided research and teaching experiences across several universities and having a mutual passion for physics education, accessibility, and outreach, Ricky and Amelia joined forces in graduate school to create a dyanmic platform to centralize physics research resources. With the help of peers, we are now creating PhysDEPOT, a hopeful solution to the suprising universal struggle of learning where to start. </p>

        <p><strong>Goals of PHYSDepot</strong></p>
      <p>Our goals at PHYSDepot are simple, yet all-encompassing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To lower the barrier of entry to physics research and mentorship by collecting as many resources and "places to start" in one location.</li>
        <li>To provide a platform for all scientists - beginner through professional - to peruse the breadth of tools created for doing physics regardless of what skills/jargon they may or may not have yet become accustomed to.</li>
        <li>To create a maintained, intuitive list of these resources and a community of learners to share ideas, open questions, and learning resources.</li>

        <p><strong>Our goal</strong> is to collect and organize: open-source datasets, catalogs, software, packages, websites, articles, workshops, tutorials, simulations - anything you've found helpful when doing or learning good science.</p>
        <p><strong>Help us by contributing your favorite resources <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9zK_ipR71q9kCxk7h67qEJ-XpsYpG13emPIKZB3zU0p1UAA/viewform?usp=send_form">here</a>.</strong> Together, we can bring all of physics research to your fingertips, one resource at a time.</p>
