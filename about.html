        <p><strong>About the Creators & Our Mission</strong></p>
        <p>Despite coming from different educational backgrounds, the creators of PHYSDepot have shared a similar experience: a life-long struggle discovering and accessing quality resources in the field of physics. As children, we (Amelia & Ricky) both shared a curiosity to explore what physics research looked like for both students and professionals. How do the showy results that appear in the headlines actually come to fruition? Excited to pursue physics as a career and disparate to begin building skills, we both did the best we could to provide for ourselves the mentorship we found ourselves lacking in our niche fields. We began to realize how high the barrier to entry is on simply exploring and reading about the open-source tools scientists across the world use to derive their results. Even locating resources designed to lower the barrier to entry on these topics proved challenging if we found ourselves alone in our interests.</p>

        <p>Moving on to pursue bachelors degrees in physics, Amelia and Ricky suprisingly saw this chasm only grow. Despite managing to cross the hurdle that is pursuing and financing a degree in physics, they found many of their peers were struggling to secure research experiences, mentorship, or any other form of direction required to pursue their dreams. Regardless of how successful they were in their coursework or other academic endeavors, many students were left in the dust for semesters at a time as resources on the colligate level were still found scarce.</p>
        <p><strong>It became strikingly clear: one of the biggest hurdles to pursuing physics research is learning where to look.</strong></p>
        <p>After pursuing semesters of guided research and teaching experiences across several universities and having a mutual passion for physics education, accessibility, and outreach, Ricky and Amelia joined forces in graduate school to create a dyanmic platform to centralize physics research resources. With the help of peers, we are now creating PhysDEPOT, a hopeful solution to the suprising struggle of understanding where to look. </p>
