                <h2>Astrophysics</h2>
                <p>Astrophysics is the study of stars, planets, black holes, galaxies, and the universe as a whole.
                    Astrophysics heavily relies on classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, nuclear
                    physics, general relativity, programming and data science to simulate and analyze astronomical
                    events.</p>

                <h2>Quantum Information </h2>
                <p>Quantum Information Science (QIS) explores how quantum systems store, process, and transmit
                    information. The field draws on computer science, condensed matter, and AMO to understand and
                    develop quantum algorithms, communication protocols, and quantum technologies.</p>

                <h2>Condensed Matter and AMO Physics</h2>
                <p>Condensed Matter and AMO physics study the behavior of matter and light on atomic and molecular
                    scales. Condensed Matter focuses on solids, liquids, and exotic phases, while AMO explores how
                    atoms, molecules, and light interact. Both fields rely heavily on quantum mechanics, and often
                    involve laboratory experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling to understand material
                    properties, quantum systems, and fundamental interactions.</p>

                <h2>Particle and Nuclear Physics </h2>
                <p>Particle and Nuclear Physics explore the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions.
                    Nuclear physics focuses on atomic nuclei, while particle physics investigates smaller components
                    like quarks, leptons, and bosons. Both fields rely on quantum field theory, special relativity, and
                    sophisticated detectors to analyze data from high-energy experiments. </p>

                <h2>Mathematical Physics </h2>
                <p>Mathematical physics uses the tools of mathematics to solve problems in theoretical physics. These
                    problems typically live in the realm of quantum mechanics, general relativity, statistical
                    mechanics, and field theory, often studied using tools from differential geometry, topology,
                    functional analysis, and algebra. Although the primary focus of mathematical physics is exact
                    solutions, it also includes approximation methods such as perturbation theory.</p>

                <p>Biophysics and Geophysics apply physics to understand biological systems and the Earth
                    (respectively). Biophysics uses statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and computational models to
                    study molecules, cells, and organisms. Geophysics draws on fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and
                    seismology to study Earth’s interior, atmosphere, and environment.</p>

                <h2> Physics Education</h2>
                <p>Physics Education is the study of how physics is taught and how students learn physics. Physics
                    Education Research (PER) is extremely diverse, and focuses on every aspect of teaching physics, from
                    equity in physics education to designing validated tests of student understanding. Physics education
                    uses tools from educational psychology, cognitive science, and data science to understand how best
                    to design curricula, create teaching tools, and analyze metrics of student success.</p>
