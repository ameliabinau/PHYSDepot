        <p>Usage Requirements: Fairly strong internet connection, decent graphics processing for downloadable software.</p>
        <p> Using either the web-based interactive or the <a href="https://stellarium.org/">downloadable application</a>, explore the night sky using this well-known software detailing the celestial sphere. Great for outreach, education, amateur astronomy, and anyone who wants to take a zoomed-in look at the night sky. Use this tool to determine exactly what the sky will look like at a specific location and time and to gain an interactive understanding of how to use popular astronomical coordinate systems. Stellarium allows you to chart magnitude, position, and other physical properties of almost all astronomical objects.</p>

        <a href = "https://altaipony.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Altaipony: Stellar Flare Time Series Statistics</a>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Python. Usage Requirements: Python-compatable IDE or Jupyter Notebooks</p>
        <p> Altaipony is used to analyze flaring data from Kepler, K2, and Tess missions. It has built-in functions that lessen the noise of photometric data and identify flares from the normalized data. It’s completely free and the data from these missions can be pulled from MAST through Altaipony. It also works with target pixel files! (and Lightkurve does all of this as well).</p>

        <p> Spectra, images, photometry. Through their extensive <a href = "https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html">catalog</a>, the Space Telescope Science Insitute allows simple querying of mass collections of astronomical data spanning missions such as JWST, Hubble, TESS, and more, including ground-based observations. Select a mission/enter the name of an astronomical target and begin querying.</p>
