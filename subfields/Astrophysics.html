        <a href="https://stellarium-web.org/">Stellarium</a>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Usage Requirements: Fairly strong internet connection, decent graphics processing for downloadable software.</p>
        <p> Using either the web-based interactive or the <a href="https://stellarium.org/">downloadable application</a>, explore the night sky using this well-known software detailing the celestial sphere. Great for outreach, education, amateur astronomy, and anyone who wants to take a zoomed-in look at the night sky. Use this tool to determine exactly what the sky will look like at a specific location and time and to gain an interactive understanding of how to use popular astronomical coordinate systems. Stellarium allows you to chart magnitude, position, and other physical properties of almost all astronomical objects.</p>

        <p>Usage Requirements: Strong internet connection. </p>
        <p> Universe Monitor is a free public website (https://www.universemonitor.com/ ) created by Dave Owen, AKA "Space Dave" of Te Awamutu, New Zealand who is also the creator of the Te Awamutu Space Centre, a space museum and education center. The website contains live feeds, video, CGI visualizations, text reports, etc. from various sources, such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory, NASA Earth Observatories, NOAA, ISS, etc, and includes recent space news, launches, and random astronomical facts. It is accessible from any device. Dave Owen writes that anyone is able to access the website for educational purposes, as well as set up public displays for science museums, observatories, schools, etc. To help keep the website ad-free, one can support their Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/SpaceCentre) and learn more about the service on their about page (https://www.universemonitor.com/home/about/).</p>

    <button class="accordion">
        <a href = "https://altaipony.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Altaipony: Stellar Flare Time Series Statistics</a>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Python. Usage Requirements: Python-compatable IDE or Jupyter Notebooks</p>
        <p> Altaipony is used to analyze flaring data from Kepler, K2, and Tess missions. It has built-in functions that lessen the noise of photometric data and identify flares from the normalized data. It’s completely free and the data from these missions can be pulled from MAST through Altaipony. It also works with target pixel files! (and Lightkurve does all of this as well).</p>

    <button class="accordion">
        <a href = "https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/index.html">MESA: Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics</a>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Terminal, Bash. Usage Requirements: Ubuntu Linux setup for windows, or IOS alternative, git packages</p>
        <p> MESA is a hydrodynamic code that simulates starts, black bodies and supernovae remnants. Often used to simulate stars along the main sequence. The applications are wide in astro and nuclear physics. You can use it to simulate the life and conditions of just about any star or black body you want. </p>

    <button class="accordion">
        <a href = "https://github.com/duffell/Disco">DISCO: 3D Moving-Mesh Magnetohydrodynamics Code for Astrophysical Disks.</a>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Terminal C-Based Language. Usage Requirements: Ubuntu Linux setup for windows or IOS alternative</p>
        <p> DISCO is a moving mesh hydrodynamics code that simulates gases moving and evolving at its core. This can be applied to any problem in Astrophysics and broader applications for hydrodynamics/fluid dynamic problems. Could simulate a pulsar or ab experiment in a lab. The basics are set up for you in templates and you can create any fluid dynamic simulation you want if you have some know how by learning basic C and reading the source code.</p>
