<!--Stellarium-->
    <button class="accordion">
        <a href="https://stellarium-web.org/">Stellarium</a>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Usage Requirements: Fairly strong internet connection, decent graphics processing for downloadable software.</p>
        <p> Using either the web-based interactive or the <a href="https://stellarium.org/">downloadable application</a>, explore the night sky using this well-known software detailing the celestial sphere. Great for outreach, education, amateur astronomy, and anyone who wants to take a zoomed-in look at the night sky. Use this tool to determine exactly what the sky will look like at a specific location and time and to gain an interactive understanding of how to use popular astronomical coordinate systems. Stellarium allows you to chart magnitude, position, and other physical properties of almost all astronomical objects.</p>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>Usage Requirements: Strong internet connection. </p>
        <p> Universe Monitor is a free public website created by Dave Owen, AKA "Space Dave" of Te Awamutu, New Zealand. Owen is also the creator of the Te Awamutu Space Centre, a space museum and education center. The website contains live feeds, video, CGI visualizations, text reports, etc. from various sources, such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory, NASA Earth Observatories, NOAA, ISS, etc, and includes recent space news, launches, and random astronomical facts. It is accessible from any device. Dave Owen writes that anyone is able to access the website for educational purposes, as well as set up public displays for science museums, observatories, and schools. To help keep the website ad-free, one can support their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/SpaceCentre">Patreon</a> and learn more about the service on their <a href="https://www.universemonitor.com/home/about/""> about page</a>.</p>

    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Usage Requirements: Works best on Linux, but also available on MacOS and Windows</p>
        <p>How do astronomers process, analyze, and display the electromagnetic data they collect through telescopes from astronomical objects? One of the most common software for this purpose is SAODS9, a product of the <a href="https://cxc.harvard.edu/">Chandra X-Ray Center (CXC)</a>. This software requires astronical data to be contained in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, which is the standard among astronomers. NASA has collected public FITS files for processing <a href="https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_samples.html">here</a> and more are available on <a href = "https://archive.stsci.edu/">MAST</a>. More informagion on other image viewers is provided <a href="https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html">here</a>.</p>

    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Python. Usage Requirements: Python-compatable IDE or Jupyter Notebooks</p>
        <p> Altaipony is used to analyze flaring data from Kepler, K2, and Tess missions. It has built-in functions that lessen the noise of photometric data and identify flares from the normalized data. It‚Äôs completely free and the data from these missions can be pulled from <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/">MAST</a> through Altaipony. It also works with target pixel files! (and <a href="https://lightkurve.github.io/lightkurve/">Lightkurve</a> does all of this as well).</p>

    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Terminal, Bash, Fortran 90. Usage Requirements: Ubuntu Linux setup for windows, or IOS alternative, git packages</p>
        <p> MESA is a hydrodynamic code that simulates stars, black bodies, and supernovae remnants. It is often used to simulate stars along the main sequence. The applications are wide in astrophysics and nuclear physics. You can use it to simulate the life and conditions of just about any star or black body you want. MESA also hosts a yearly <a href = "https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/summer_schools.html">summer school</a>; past summer schools have their materials published <a href = https://maygpedersen.github.io/mesa-down-under-2024/program.html">online</a>. </p>

    </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color:midnightblue"> Language Requirement(s): Terminal C-Based Language. Usage Requirements: Ubuntu Linux setup for windows or IOS alternative</p>
        <p> DISCO is a moving-mesh hydrodynamics code that simulates gases moving and evolving at its core. This can be applied to any problem in astrophysics and broader applications for other hydrodynamic/fluid dynamic problems. For example, one could simulate a pulsar or a fluid-based experiment in a lab. The basics are set up for you in templates and you can create any fluid dynamic simulation you want simply by utilizing a little basic C and reading the source code.</p>
