                        using this well-known software detailing the celestial sphere. Great for outreach, education,
                        amateur astronomy, and anyone who wants to take a zoomed-in look at the night sky. Use this tool
                        to determine exactly what the sky will look like at a specific location and time and to gain an
                        interactive understanding of how to use popular astronomical coordinate systems. Stellarium
                        allows you to chart magnitude, position, and other physical properties of almost all
                        astronomical objects.</p>

                    <p>Universe Monitor is a free public website created by Dave Owen, AKA "Space Dave" of Te Awamutu,
                        New Zealand. Owen is also the creator of the Te Awamutu Space Centre, a space museum and
                        education center. The website contains live feeds, video, CGI visualizations, text reports, etc.
                        from various sources, such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory, NASA Earth Observatories, NOAA,
                        ISS, etc, and includes recent space news, launches, and random astronomical facts. It is
                        accessible from any device. Dave Owen writes that anyone is able to access the website for
                        educational purposes, as well as set up public displays for science museums, observatories, and
                        schools. To help keep the website ad-free, one can support their Patreon and learn more about
                        the

                        MacOS and Windows</p>
                    <p>How do astronomers process, analyze, and display the electromagnetic data they collect through
                        telescopes from astronomical objects? One of the most common software for this purpose is
                        SAODS9, a product of theChandra X-Ray Center (CXC). This software requires astronomical data to
                        be
                        contained in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, which is the standard among
                        astronomers. NASA has collected public FITS files for processing here and more are available
                        onMAST. More information on other image viewers is provided here.</p>

                    <p>Slooh is a powerful online platform that allows educators and amateur astronomers remotely access telescopes in Chile, the Canary Islands, and Australia. Simply select a target & telescope, queue a scheduling block, adjust preferences, and watch as your research-grade image is captured. It is a brilliant, interactive way to explore the cosmos. Slooh hosts a variety of educational events and more advanced research options (have your data exported as FITS files for more detailed examination) and a constant stream of observations is available to watch in real-time. While the service comes with a price, I helped use this platform for <href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/outreach/">Purdue University's physics and astronomy outreach program</href> and I can personally attest it is worth the investment if you're strongly interested in amateur astronomy but are overwhelmed with the mechanics/cost of a full personal telescope.</p>

                        and nuclear physics. You can use it to simulate the life and conditions of just about any star
                        or black body you want. MESA also hosts a yearlysummer school; past summer schools have their
