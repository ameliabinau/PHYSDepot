        <h2><strong>Getting Started, Resource Onboarding Projects</strong></h2>

        <p>Interested in dabbling with research tools from a specific subfield, but looking for guidance on where to start? Joing a lab and need some relevant independent, hands-on experience? Below is a list of existing or homebrew examples, tutorials, and "worksheets" available for beginners or scientists looking to learn about other fields using resources listed on PHYSDepots main directories. Many homebrew examples/activites are imply downloadable Python Notebooks with clear instructions and physical explainations for producing science-quality results from corresponding packages, datasets, etc.</p>

            <div class="content">
            <p>The usage of the code is very straightforward. Hit run, and you will be guided through a short menu system where you choose whether you want to compute and plot either a basic Mandelbrot set, a basic Julia set, a Multibrot set, a Multibrot Julia set, or a seeded Mandelbrot set. For each type, you will need to enter in a couple of numbers, ranging from the initial condition z0, a specific constant c, the value of the exponent, as well as the number of iterations you want, and hence the precision of the plots. The code is very well-commented and should be easy to read.

 Mandelbrot and Julia sets appear in mathematics and are a very popular type of set that is often used to represent the beauty inherent in mathematics, as they are fractal patterns that are very beautiful to look at and relate to niche topics in complex analysis. The basic idea is that you are plotting real and imaginary pairs of points of a bunch of constants c that are fed into a recursive relation. The constants that result in divergences of the recursion are thrown out, and the constants that stay bounded are plotted. The resulting set of points is the Mandelbrot set, which follows the relation:

z_next = z^n + c

where the standard Mandelbrot set chooses specifically z0 = 0 and n = 2, where z0 is the initial condition of the complex number z that is first fed into the recursion relation. Other types of sets are constructed by basically changing z0, the exponent n, or iterating over different parameters.
